1. https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/agent/firstbot-rwug/intents
2. crate a agent
3. then create a intents
try it now
4. create over the intent and you can config intent and response
it will be a little bit boring
conversastion will be boring
5. if something has not been tain over the intent it will go for fallback intent
6. you can create your custom intent
question will not be same as intent but it will be aware about it
7. use knowledge base
you can keep the question which are asking frequnetly
you can dump in knowledge feature
8. entities
weather 
genral question does not make sense
we need to specify the city
so in city variable we can have city name
go inside the entity 
city name 
kolkata
calcutta 
bangalore
bangluru
sys-geo-city 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. fullfilment
2. integration
google dialog flow--->pyhton app--->weather API
openweathermap
you need to subceribe this
request and response in API
what we want
just give the city name and get a weather
3. flask API
4. route name webhook(conventation)
5. weather API
api call structure
api response structure
5. in dialog flow we have a request structure
queryresult
parameter
city
then you will get a name delhi
6. so the process will be 
           jsonreq
Dialog Flow<---python--->APi
           ---->     <----
           jsonresp
step by step we getting city name via json response
and we are seding req to API
then we are getting ans that we are extracting
and then we are sending it to full fillment text
